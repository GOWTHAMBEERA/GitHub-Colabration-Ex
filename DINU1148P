DINESH

  Whispers of Nature

Beneath the sky so vast and wide,
Where sun and clouds in silence bide,
The wind hums soft through branches tall,
A melody, a timeless call.

The river winds through valleys deep,
A secret that the mountains keep,
Its waters dance with gentle grace,
Reflecting light, a mirror’s face.

The trees, they stand like ancient guards,
With roots that speak in quiet words,
Their leaves, a symphony in green,
A chorus sung by unseen sheen.

The flowers bloom with hues so bright,
A brushstroke born of pure delight,
Each petal, soft as morning’s kiss,
A fleeting moment full of bliss.

The moon ascends, so calm, so fair,
A silver lantern in the air,
It casts its glow on every hill,
And paints the world with magic still.

Nature speaks in whispers soft,
A language old, yet soaring aloft,
In every gust and leaf and stone,
It speaks the truth — we’re not alone.
