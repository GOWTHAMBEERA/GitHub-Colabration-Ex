Cricket is a popular sport played between two teams,
each consisting of eleven players. Originating in England, it is now played and followed worldwide,
especially in countries like India, Australia, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies. 
The game involves a combination of skill, strategy, and athleticism, with batters and bowlers playing key roles.

A standard cricket match is played on an oval-shaped field, with a 22-yard-long pitch at the center. 
The objective of the game is for one team to score more runs than the other.
Runs are scored by the batter hitting the ball and running between two wickets at either end of the pitch.
A batter can also score boundaries (four or six runs) by hitting the ball to the edge of the field or over the boundary line without it touching the ground.

Cricket has three main formats: **Test cricket**, **One Day Internationals (ODIs)**, and **Twenty20 (T20)**. Test cricket is the longest format, with matches lasting up to five days.
It is known for its strategic depth and is often considered the purest form of the game. ODIs are limited to 50 overs per team,
typically played over a single day, offering a faster-paced alternative to Test matches.
T20 cricket is the shortest format, where each team has 20 overs to score as many runs as possible, 
resulting in a high-energy, fast-paced game that has become immensely popular in recent years.

A cricket team is made up of **batters**, **bowlers**, **all-rounders**, and a **wicketkeeper**. 
Batters are the players who attempt to score runs by hitting the ball, while bowlers deliver the ball to dismiss the batters. 
Bowlers can bowl fast (pace bowlers) or slow (spin bowlers), each with different techniques and strategies.
All-rounders are players who excel at both batting and bowling, adding flexibility to the team.
The wicketkeeper is positioned behind the batter to catch balls that are not hit and to attempt run-outs or stumpings.

The bowler's objective is to dismiss the batter by hitting the stumps (the three wooden sticks behind the batter) or forcing the batter to make a mistake, resulting in an out.
A batter can be dismissed in various ways, such as **bowled**, **caught**, **run out**, or **lbw** (leg before wicket).
Once a batter is out, a new batter replaces them until ten batters are dismissed, at which point the teams switch roles, and the second inning begins.

The match ends when both teams have completed their innings, and the team with the highest total runs wins.
In the case of a tie or draw, particularly in Test matches, specific rules apply to determine the outcome. 

In addition to the formats, cricket also has an important role in **international competitions**, such as the ICC Cricket World Cup for ODIs, the ICC T20 World Cup,
and the Ashes series between England and Australia in Test cricket. These events attract millions of viewers and showcase the global appeal of the sport.

Cricket also has a rich culture, with famous players like Sir Donald Bradman, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, and Shane Warne becoming legends.
The sport's history, traditions, and evolving nature make it one of the most beloved and followed sports worldwide.
